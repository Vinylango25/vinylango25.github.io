    <h2>üè• Healthcare Accessibility in Nairobi</h2>
    <p>
    In 2015, the United Nations introduced the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a global framework aimed at tackling critical issues such as poverty, hunger, climate change, and health. Among these, SDG 3: Good Health and Wellbeing is especially vital because health underpins many other development goals by influencing economic growth, education, and social stability. This goal‚Äôs broad focus‚Äîfrom reducing maternal and child mortality to combating epidemics and promoting mental health‚Äîhighlights the essential role that good health plays in creating sustainable, resilient communities worldwide.
    <p>
    <img src="fig6.png" alt="Healthcare Accessibility"/>
    <p>
     Kenya integrates this global agenda within its Vision 2030 plan, which seeks to transform the country into a middle-income economy with better living standards, emphasizing equitable and efficient healthcare. Nairobi, as the economic and demographic hub, faces unique urban health challenges, especially for vulnerable populations in informal settlements. Despite progress through reforms like the Social Health Authority and moves toward Universal Health Coverage, Nairobi still grapples with disparities in healthcare access and quality. This report uses detailed data to analyze these gaps, revealing critical areas needing improvement such as maternal care and 24-hour service availability, and offers targeted recommendations to guide policymakers toward achieving SDG 3 in Nairobi and beyond. üëâ Read the full project on <a href="https://github.com/Vinylango25/Healthcare-Accessibility-in-Nairobi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a> or <a href="https://medium.com/@vinylango90/enhancing-healthcare-accessibility-in-nairobi-kenya-ee275471faa7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Medium</a>

    <h2>üõ°Ô∏è Anomaly and Fraud Detection in Finance</h2>
    <p>
    Anomaly detection in financial markets is essential for identifying unusual patterns that may indicate fraud or other risks, especially as financial data becomes more complex and voluminous. Traditional methods often fall short in handling this scale and diversity, which has led to the adoption of advanced tools like PyOD and Microsoft AutoML (FLAML). PyOD offers a wide range of specialized algorithms, including statistical and machine learning techniques such as Isolation Forest and Autoencoders, that effectively detect anomalies in various financial metrics. Meanwhile, Microsoft AutoML powered by FLAML automates model selection and hyperparameter tuning, enabling faster and more accurate anomaly detection with less manual effort. Together, these technologies help financial institutions improve risk management and protect assets with greater precision and efficiency.
    <p>
    <img src="fg7.png" alt="Fraud Detection" />
    <p>
     This work focuses on detecting credit card fraud using an imbalanced dataset from Kaggle, where transactions are labeled as authentic or fraudulent. Various PyOD and FLAML models were evaluated to identify anomalous transactions, with different data balancing techniques like undersampling, oversampling, and SMOTE applied to address the class imbalance. Instead of relying solely on accuracy, the evaluation employed more robust metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC, which are better suited for imbalanced datasets. This comprehensive approach aims to enhance the detection of fraudulent activities and provide more reliable insights for financial fraud prevention. üëâ Read the full project on <a href="https://github.com/Vinylango25/Anomaly-Fraud-detection-in-Finance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Github</a> or <a href="https://medium.com/@vinylango90/anomaly-detection-in-credit-card-transactions-using-pyod-and-microsoft-automl-flaml-727a091487bd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Medium</a>

    <h2>ü§ñ Lending Automation - ML for Credit Scoring</h2>
    <p>
    The automation of lending decisions through machine learning is revolutionizing the financial sector by replacing slow, manual, and often biased processes with fast, scalable, and data-driven alternatives. Traditional methods have been limited by inefficiencies and inconsistencies, which particularly affected underserved groups. Machine learning models can analyze extensive borrower data within seconds‚Äîdemographics, credit history, behavioral traits‚Äîleading to more accurate risk assessments and faster approvals. This level of automation reduces human error, cuts operational costs, and allows lenders to process large volumes of applications simultaneously, making it especially beneficial for fintech firms and digital lenders aiming for rapid service delivery.
    <p>
    <img src="cost.png" alt="Credit Scoring" />
    <p>
    This project aims to implement and compare the effectiveness of three prominent machine learning algorithms‚ÄîRandom Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM‚Äîin automating loan decision-making. By analyzing real-world credit data, the project focuses on optimizing predictive performance, reducing false approvals or rejections, and improving decision speed and fairness. Tasks include data preparation, feature engineering, model training, performance evaluation, and deployment. Ultimately, the system is designed not only to boost accuracy and operational efficiency but also to support personalized lending and dynamic pricing strategies. This approach positions automated credit scoring as a strategic advantage in achieving profitability, customer satisfaction, and regulatory compliance in a rapidly evolving financial landscape.  üëâ Read the full project on <a href="https://github.com/Vinylango25/Credit-Scoring-Lending-automation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Github</a> or <a href="https://medium.com/@vinylango90/credit-scoring-lending-automation-6dabe30d53da" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Medium</a>

    <h2>üåç Air Quality Monitoring in Nicosia, Cyprus</h2>
     <p>
    Air pollution continues to pose significant risks to both environmental sustainability and public health, with harmful pollutants like carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and sulfur dioxide contributing to serious respiratory and cardiovascular issues. Conventional monitoring relies on reference-grade instruments, which, while highly accurate, are limited by their high cost and sparse spatial coverage‚Äîespecially in urban areas with localized pollution patterns. To overcome these limitations, low-cost sensors (LCSs), particularly electrochemical ones, are increasingly adopted due to their affordability and portability. However, LCSs suffer from challenges such as signal drift, environmental sensitivity, and cross-gas interference, making their raw data unreliable for regulatory purposes without further calibration.
    <p>
    <img src="dqo.png" alt="Air Quality Monitoring" />
    <p>
    To address these shortcomings, this project investigates the use of machine learning (ML) for post-deployment calibration of LCS data, collected over six months in Nicosia, Cyprus. Five ML models‚ÄîLinear Regression, Support Vector Regression, Random Forest, Artificial Neural Networks, and XGBoost‚Äîare compared to determine their effectiveness in correcting sensor inaccuracies and aligning readings with reference-grade data. The study also examines the impact of different sampling strategies, calibration frequencies, and the volume of training data on model performance. By evaluating calibrated outputs against EU and EPA standards, the project explores whether LCSs can be reliably used for indicative air quality monitoring. Additionally, it analyzes the influence of environmental factors and feature importance in improving sensor accuracy, offering valuable insights for future deployments and regulatory integration. üëâ Read the full project on <a href="https://github.com/Vinylango25/Air-Quality-in-Nicosia-Cyprus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Github</a> or <a href="https://medium.com/@vinylango90/sensor-calibration-and-air-quality-monitoring-in-nicosia-cyprus-e5072a4184aa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Medium</a>

    <h2>üìâ Customer Churn Analysis and Prediction</h2>
    <p>
    Customer attrition, or churn, refers to the loss of clients over time and is a critical concern for businesses in subscription-based industries such as telecommunications, insurance, and online services. These companies rely heavily on customer retention strategies because acquiring new customers is significantly more expensive than maintaining existing ones. To combat attrition, many businesses use predictive analytics to identify at-risk customers early. By leveraging churn prediction models, they can prioritize outreach and design targeted retention campaigns aimed at preventing high-risk customers from leaving, ultimately improving long-term profitability.
    <p>
    <img src="churn.png" alt="Air Quality Monitoring" />
    <p>
    This project focuses on using survival analysis and predictive modeling to understand and forecast customer churn. The goal is not only to build accurate churn prediction models but also to provide deeper insights into individual customer behavior. An interactive application will be developed to allow users to analyze specific customers, understand the factors contributing to their likelihood of churn, and estimate their expected lifetime value. This dual focus‚Äîon both prediction and interpretation‚Äîwill support data-driven decisions for customer engagement and retention efforts. üëâ Read the full project on <a href="https://github.com/Vinylango25/Customer_Churn_Analysis_And_Prediction" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Github</a>
