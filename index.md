# üíº Featured Projects 

## üè• Healthcare Accessibility in Nairobi

![Figure 1: Age distribution](fig6.png)

This project conducted a comprehensive data-driven analysis of healthcare accessibility across Nairobi's sub-counties, examining population demographics, healthcare facility distribution, and service availability in relation to SDG Goal 3 (Good Health and Wellbeing). Through spatial and statistical analysis, the study identified key disparities in access, particularly in informal settlements, and proposed actionable, evidence-based recommendations to improve healthcare infrastructure, enhance service delivery, and support equitable access to medical resources for underserved communities. üëâ Read the full project on [GitHub](https://github.com/Vinylango25/Healthcare-Accessibility-in-Nairobi)  or  [Medium](https://medium.com/@vinylango90/enhancing-healthcare-accessibility-in-nairobi-kenya-ee275471faa7)

## üõ°Ô∏è Anomaly and Fraud Detection in Finance

![Figure 1: Age distribution](fg7.png)

This project developed a scalable and interpretable fraud detection pipeline for highly imbalanced credit card transaction data. It employed advanced sampling techniques like SMOTE and SMOTEENN to balance the dataset and evaluated a range of models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, LightGBM, KNN, and Isolation Forest. AutoML tools such as FLAML and PyOD enhanced model tuning and anomaly detection. Feature selection methods (RFE, Mutual Information) were applied to retain key predictors, and performance was assessed using precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrices. To ensure transparency, LIME and SHAP were used for model explainability, enabling clear interpretation of fraud predictions. üëâ Read the full project on [Github](https://github.com/Vinylango25/Anomaly-Fraud-detection-in-Finance) or  [Medium](https://medium.com/@vinylango90/anomaly-detection-in-credit-card-transactions-using-pyod-and-microsoft-automl-flaml-727a091487bd)

## ü§ñ Lending Automation - ML for Credit Scoring

![Figure 1: Age distribution](cost.png)


This project evaluated the application of machine learning models‚Äîspecifically Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM‚Äîfor automating credit scoring and lending decisions in order to streamline the loan approval process, reduce manual intervention, and optimize operational efficiency. The models were trained on historical loan application data to predict creditworthiness, using engineered features that captured borrower behavior, financial indicators, and risk patterns. Comparative analysis focused on performance metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to determine each model's predictive power and reliability. In addition to model accuracy, emphasis was placed on computational efficiency and scalability to ensure the solution could be deployed in real-time lending environments. The outcome demonstrated that ML-driven credit scoring can significantly shorten processing time, reduce default risk, and enable data-driven lending strategies that improve customer experience and operational throughput.  üëâ Read the full project on [Github](https://github.com/Vinylango25/Credit-Scoring-Lending-automation) or [Medium](https://medium.com/@vinylango90/credit-scoring-lending-automation-6dabe30d53da)

## üåç Air Quality Monitoring in Nicosia, Cyprus

![Figure 1: Age distribution](dqo.png)

This project focused on developing and evaluating machine learning models‚Äînamely Random Forest, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and XGBoost‚Äîto calibrate low-cost gas sensors measuring pollutants such as CO, NO‚ÇÇ, O‚ÇÉ, and SO‚ÇÇ for urban air quality monitoring. The primary objective was to improve sensor accuracy and achieve data quality standards compliant with EU directives. To address challenges posed by sensor cross-sensitivity and environmental variability, the models incorporated techniques for correcting sensor interference and adjusting for ambient conditions such as temperature and humidity. Feature engineering and data preprocessing played a key role in enhancing model robustness. The calibrated models successfully improved the reliability of gas concentration readings, particularly for CO, NO‚ÇÇ, and O‚ÇÉ. In addition to model development, the project proposed a scalable and cost-effective sensor network deployment strategy to support continuous, real-time air quality monitoring in urban environments, making the solution both scientifically rigorous and practically deployable.  üëâ Read the full project on [Github](https://github.com/Vinylango25/Air-Quality-in-Nicosia-Cyprus)  or [Medium](https://medium.com/@vinylango90/sensor-calibration-and-air-quality-monitoring-in-nicosia-cyprus-e5072a4184aa)
